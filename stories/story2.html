What did that one teacher do that you'll never forget? I was born with cerebral palsy and I believed my mom every time she told me it was cool to have it. I thought people were jealous of the way I walked because nobody else looked like me. That completely changed when I got to high school because they couldn't afford to send me to a special school anymore. I was the only Black kid and I got bullied on the first day there. However, that wasn't anything compared to the principal's son. He knew he could get away with anything. So, he constantly made fun of me for the way I moved and talked. And since every teacher was too afraid to punish him, he didn't stop. He kicked my canes out from under me a few times. And when my mom asked how I got the bruises from falling, I lied and said my shoes made me trip. Well, they saved up and bought me special walking shoes, and it made me so happy. The first day I wore them to school, that kid took them and threw them in the garbage. By the time I knew where they were, it was too late. And the only person who saw what happened was our math teacher. This guy hated our principal and hated his son even more. He knew what he did, and in that moment didn't care about what was going to happen. He took that kid into his classroom and yelled so loud everyone in the school heard it. The kid left the room crying and went straight to his dad. A week later, he lost his job and could never teach again. But the day he was clearing his stuff out of his room, he gave me a box. It was another pair of the shoes he had bought for me, and I still have them to this day, 30 years later,
