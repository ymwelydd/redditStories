What was the hardest time you've had to hold back tears? When I found out what Smurf Day was. When I was in college, everyone told me they were really jealous of me because of one of my teachers, but I didn’t really get why. He was old and quiet and just seemed like a normal guy to me. I heard a few people call him Mr. Smurf, which really confused me. But eventually, one guy asked if I had seen Smurf Day yet. I had no idea what he was talking about and thought it was a joke. When I asked him what he meant, he just said, “You’ll see.” Apparently, this guy had a three-year-old daughter, and a few years before, she was diagnosed with a rare brain disease. She was bedridden in the hospital, and after he was done teaching, he would go sit with her every night. And since the Smurfs was her favorite show, he’d always watch it with her. Apparently, it got worse and she didn’t have much longer. But since he was a single dad, he had to keep teaching to pay for everything. He’d come to class completely broken. However, eventually some students found out about this and started a GoFundMe for him. They raised over $15,000 so he could take time off work. And because of them, he got to spend her last few days with her. And since then, every year he shows up like this on her
