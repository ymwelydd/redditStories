Tattoo artists, what's the most disturbing tattoo request you've gotten? An 18-year-old girl came to my shop who refused to tell me what her tattoo meant until I finished it, so I couldn't back out. She asked me if I could do a barcode tattoo for her, which at first I didn't think was too weird. Typically, I have people who want a QR code tattoo so that they could rick roll people, but she told me this was much more serious. Something else people do is have the numbers under the barcode be someone's birthday, but she didn't ask for that either. When I was doing her the prep work on her, I noticed something was entirely off about her. Her eyes were sunken like she hadn't slept for days, and her skin was so pale, as if she came out of a grave before seeing me. She had me trace the barcode from a paper she ripped up, so I had no idea what scanning this meant. When I finished her barcode tattoo, she started crying, which I expected. But this was some of the ugliest cries I ever heard. After calming her down for about 30 minutes, she told me about the tattoo. She told me that when she was 14, she was diagnosed with cancer, that her single father couldn't afford to pay alone. Her father started a GoFundMe, posting videos three times a day for nearly 3 years, trying to raise money for her. Unfortunately, whenever he did go viral, people laughed at him, calling him an online scam artist, so he started pulling double shifts every day without breaks at a warehouse, raising as much money as he could to pay for her treatment. Eventually, she made a full recovery, but her father passed away in a tragic work accident. To honor him, she tattooed a barcode that when scanned shows the thousands of hours he worked, which she deemed as the price of her life.
